# ![https://mouredev.com](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/camilorava/camilorava/master/avatarProgramador.jpg) Hello, my name is Camilo Ramirez
### Software Developer Back-End (Engineer of Systems)

![https://github.com/camilorava](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/camilorava/camilorava/master/Desarrollador.jpg)

I'm a professional software developer for more than ten years.

In 2014 I left my job at a multinational and create [**MoureDev**](https://mouredev.com), the reflection of my dream to grow as a professional within the software development industry.
Since then I have dedicated myself to specializing in mobile application development, collaborating with companies from different parts of the world, creating more than 60 Apps and founding my own startup.

In 2018 I return to my small hometown in Galicia (Spain), and I begin to create programming content and share my experience as a developer on platforms such as YouTube, Udemy and Twitch. I want to return all the knowledge that the community has shared with me for free.
